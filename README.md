# Dungeon Master Worker

The DungeonMaster worker managing two different RaidGUild Discord bots: DungeonMaster (limited managing) and RaidGuild Guard (full mananging).

For the DungeonMaster bot, the worker only handles the answering querires about DungeonMaster CRM data.

RaidGuild Guard welcomes everyone who joins the Discord server, and informs them to go to #unlock-channels to view public channels. Those who pass the guild.xyz test are automatically assigned the Moloch Soldier role, which gives permission to view and send messages in the public channels of Raid Guildâ€™s Discord server.

RaidGuild Guard does not allow bots to join the server.
